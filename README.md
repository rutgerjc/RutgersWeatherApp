# RutgersWeatherApp

### Hello, my name is Rutger!

This repository/project is named RutgersWeatherApp!
It is a demo weather app I created to help build and hone my android app developer skills.

I chose to take on this project because I believe it helped me reinforce my ability to work with APIs and app UI.

This app takes user-input of any city the user would like to see. It outputs
standard and current weather details, based on the user's input and current weather data.

Some challenges I encounter were the initial steps to creating and calling API's. originally i used 3rd party library Volley to fetch my weather data respones.
