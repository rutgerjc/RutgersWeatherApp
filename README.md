# RutgersWeatherApp
Demo app

Hello, my name is Rutger

This repository/project is named RutgersWeatherApp!
It is a demo weather app I created to help build and hone my android app developer skills.

This app takes user input of any city they would like to see. It outputs
standard and current weather details, based on the user's input.
